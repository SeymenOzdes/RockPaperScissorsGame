# RockPaperScissorsGame
This project includes a simple iOS app that implements a rock✊-paper🫱-scissors✌️ game using SwiftUI. Players make their choices to win or lose while playing against the computer and gain or lose points depending on the result. At the end of the game, players receive information based on their performance.
